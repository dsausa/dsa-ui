# @dsa-ui

This is a design system built with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Storybook](https://tailwindcss.com/) for Democratic Socialists of America sites and applications by the DSA National Tech Committee.

It will incorporate branding from [design.dsausa.org](http://design.dsausa.org) and [the mydsa figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1Hty7YjMHXRHPwbESKUBf1/mydsa-public-01).

> _DISCLAIMER: This is an exploratory respository and not yet officially endorsed by the DSA nor the National Tech Committee. While it is public for now, that is subject to change._

## Getting Started

### Quick Tour

This repo currently has two sibling repositories, `./react` and `./wc`.

Each corresponds to a published package: `@dsa-ui/react` for native React components and `@dsa-ui/wc` for web components that can be used in any other framework (or no framework).

>#### `./.vs-code`

Contains some settings and extension suggestions helpful for working with this toolset. Feel free to add other tweaks or disregard them if they do not suit your needs.

>#### `./react`

This is a __generated__ native React library. __You should not work in this package or change any files__ unless you are making adjustments to the `package.json` or other non-generated file for publishing purposes.
Any changes to the components should be made in `./wc`.

>#### `./wc`

_This is where the magic happens._ Development, testing, stories, and publishing are controlled from this directory.

>>#### `/src`

Generated types and a static site for development. These can be ignored.

>>>#### `/components`

Each component has its own directory. Each contains a `.tsx` file that contains the component itself as well as tests and stylesheets (which can be ignored in favor of tailwind).

>>#### `/stories`

Story files, which can be simple like `my-component.stories.tsx` (which takes advantage of auto-generation) or complex. Each file can hold multiple stories with different arguments and arrangements to test and doc different states.

### Start Development

```bash
npm run init
npm start
```

- Starts a build of web components, watches for changes
- Builds a custom elements manifest that helps Storybook generate helpful docs
- Starts a Storybook server on `http://localhost:6006`

_Note: The cem mapping complexity can be removed if we move Storybook to the React project. However, that would require rebuilding the React project on every change, which would add latency to the hot reload._

### Build For Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds web components and syncs the React library.

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Publish a change to NPM

__Patch__ for internal changes, __minor__ for new features, and __major__ for breaking changes. If you're not sure, make it minor. (This breakdown came from Copilot and I am down with it.)

```bash
npm run bump --newversion=patch
```

This will ensure tests pass and then bump versions on all three `package.json`s. In order to publish to NPM and deploy to Github Pages, the corresponding PR should have the label `bump`.

## Creating New Components

Navigate to `./wc/src/components` and create a new directory for your component. The directory name should be the same as the component name. Use the prefix `dsa`; i.e., `dsa-button` or `dsa-card`.

Inside the directory, create a `.tsx` file with the same name as the directory. You can use the demo file, `my-component.tsx`, as a template. Additionally, create a `.spec.ts` file for unit tests, a `.e2e.ts` file for end-to-end tests, and a `.css` file if you need styles beyond what Tailwind provides. Please ensure near-complete test coverage.

### Component Structure

```tsx  


import { Component, Prop, h } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
  tag: 'dsa-component', // HTML tag
  styleUrl: 'dsa-component.css', // styles, if needed
  shadow: true, // set to `true`-- encapsulated DOM and styles
})
export class MyComponent {

  @Prop() name: string; // indicate a public prop (attribute) on the component-- establishes a public API

  private message = "My name is "; // mark an internal prop as private; use `@State()` if you need to trigger a re-render when it changes

  render() { // return JSX, just like React
    return (
      <p>
        {this.message + this.name}
      </p>
    );
  }
}
```

For more information on writing Stencil components, see the [Stencil docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/my-first-component).

### Adding a Story

You will also need to create a `.stories.tsx` file for Storybook in the `./wc/stories` directory. This file will be used to generate documentation and test the component in different states.

```js
// full, working example of a generated story
import { formatArgs } from './utils/utils';

export default {
  title: 'Example/MyComponent',
  component: 'my-component',
};

const Template = (args) => `<my-component ${formatArgs(args)}></my-component>`;

export const Default = Template.bind({});
```

In many cases, you will only need to change the `title` and `component` variables, and the tag name in the `Template()` function. If your need is more complex, consult the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/writing-stories/introduction).

## Getting Started

**\_NOTE:** This section assumes some familiarity with the Node.js ecosystem and
the command line. If you're new to these tools, check out
[the From Scratch guide](./docs/long-start.md).

### Quick Tour

This repo currently has a root package and two sibling packages, `./react` and
`./wc`.

Each corresponds to a published package: `@dsa-ui/react` for native React
components and `@dsa-ui/wc` for web components that can be used in any other
framework (or no framework).

> #### `.`

The root! You can run the node scripts listed below from this directory. This
allows us to keep our two packages synced.

> #### `./.vs-code`

Contains some settings and extension suggestions helpful for working with this
toolset. Feel free to add other tweaks or disregard them if they do not suit
your needs.

> #### `./react`

This is a **generated** native React library. **You should not work in this
package or change any files** unless you are making adjustments to the
`package.json` or other non-generated file for publishing purposes. Any changes
to the components should be made in `./wc`.

> #### `./wc`

_This is where the magic happens._ Development, testing, stories, and publishing
are controlled from this directory.

> > #### `/src`

Generated types and a static site for development. These can be ignored.

> > > #### `/components`

Each component has its own directory. Each contains a `.tsx` file that contains
the component itself as well as tests and stylesheets.

> > #### `/stories`

Story files, which can be simple like `my-component.stories.tsx` (which takes
advantage of auto-generation) or complex. Each file can hold multiple stories
with different arguments and arrangements to test and doc different states.

### Start Development

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

- Installs dependencies in all three packages: root, wc, and react.
- Starts a dev build of web components and watches for changes
- Builds a custom elements manifest that helps Storybook generate helpful docs
- Starts a Storybook server on `http://localhost:6006`

**\_NOTE:** After the first time, simply run **`yarn start`**.\_

### Build For Production

```bash
yarn build:prod
```

Builds optimized web components and syncs the React library.

### Run Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

### Update the Version

Use `patch` for internal changes, `minor` for new features, and `major` for
breaking changes. If you're not sure, make it minor. For more information, see
[semver](https://semver.org/).

```bash
yarn bump --patch
```

This will ensure tests pass and, bump versions on all three `package.json`s, and
create a version bump pull request. Once merged, the `main` branch will be
tagged with the new version, the packages will be published to npm, and
[the Storybook site](https://dsausa.github.io/dsa-ui/) will be deployed.

**\_NOTE:** In order to use this command, you must have:\_

- _No git changes compared to `main`_
- _All tests in `./wc` passing_
- _`ADMIN` or `MAINTAIN` role on the repo; for the script to check those
  permissions, you will need:_
  - _[The GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/) installed and logged in_
  - _[The `gh-role` extension](https://github.com/nedredmond/gh-role) added to
    the CLI_
    - `gh extension install nedredmond/gh-role`

## Creating New Components

Navigate to `./wc/src/components` and create a new directory for your component.
The directory name should be the same as the component name. Use the prefix
`dsa`; i.e., `dsa-button` or `dsa-card`.

Inside the directory, create a `.tsx` file with the same name as the directory.
You can use the demo file, `my-component.tsx`, as a template. Additionally,
create a `.spec.ts` file for unit tests, a `.e2e.ts` file for end-to-end tests,
and a `.css` file. Please ensure near-complete test coverage.

### Component Structure

```tsx
import { Component, Prop, h } from "@stencil/core";

@Component({
  tag: "dsa-component", // HTML tag
  styleUrl: "dsa-component.css", // styles, if needed
  shadow: true, // set to `true`-- encapsulated DOM and styles
})
export class MyComponent {
  @Prop() name: string; // indicate a public prop (attribute) on the component-- establishes a public API

  private message = "My name is "; // mark an internal prop as private; use `@State()` if you need to trigger a re-render when it changes

  render() {
    // return JSX, just like React
    return <p>{this.message + this.name}</p>;
  }
}
```

For more information on writing Stencil components, see the
[Stencil docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/my-first-component).

### Adding a Story

You will also need to create a `.stories.tsx` file for Storybook in the
`./wc/stories` directory. This file will be used to generate documentation and
test the component in different states.

```js
// full, working example of a generated story
import { formatArgs } from "./utils/utils";

export default {
  title: "Example/MyComponent",
  component: "my-component",
};

const Template = (args) => `<my-component ${formatArgs(args)}></my-component>`;

export const Default = Template.bind({});
```

In many cases, you will only need to change the `title` and `component`
variables, and the tag name in the `Template()` function. If your need is more
complex, consult the
[Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/writing-stories/introduction).
